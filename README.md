Patterns:
  Factory: (Simple, Method, Abstract, Static)
    When to Use: When you need to create objects, but the exact class of the object may not be known until runtime.
    Why Beginner-Friendly: It helps understand object creation, and it's easy to implement. It separates the object creation logic from the code that uses the objects.
  Singleton: (Classic, Thread-safe, Eager-Initialization, Lazy-Initialization with parameter)
    When to Use: When you want to ensure only one instance of a class is created, like a configuration manager or database connection.
    Why Beginner-Friendly: It introduces the concept of controlling object instances, making it easy to manage shared resources in an application.
  Observer:
    When to Use: When you need objects (observers) to automatically update based on changes in another object (subject). Think event listeners or notification systems.
    Why Beginner-Friendly: It helps beginners learn how to manage state changes and event-driven programming.
  Strategy:
    When to Use: When you want to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure, such as adding logging or validation.
    Why Beginner-Friendly: Itâ€™s a simple concept that shows how to extend functionality dynamically, promoting code reuse.
  Decorator:
    When to Use: When you need to switch between different algorithms or behaviors dynamically, such as different sorting strategies or payment methods.
    Why Beginner-Friendly: It introduces the concept of separating algorithms, making your code more flexible and modular.
